This is the code challenge By Alejandro Lopez

Didn't make it till the end

Implemented =>

* Activities controller with the implementation of activities service to get the activities
* Sessions controller with the implementation of sessions service to get de activities and sort the data

Data is grouped and returns the correct format but is not divided in sessions ( work still in progress, sorry about that )

TODO:
* Rspec gem is added but time was limited
* Error handling for custom error status


And sorry about the only commit, worked on office repo and.. had to delete it
